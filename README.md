# Canvas Record and Playback

<p> A simple JavaScript program was created using canvas to capture strokes and draw them when the playback button was hit. 
  When playing back the first collection, the time elapsed to begin drawing strokes. 
  Each subsequent collection is drawn after the difference between the time elapsed for that collection and the previous collection.
